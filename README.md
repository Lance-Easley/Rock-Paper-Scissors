# Side Project
This is my repository for my "Rock Paper Scissors" project, 
my second project that I made during Base Camp Coding Academy.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This project was my first time using the `random` module. 
The player chooses rock, paper, or scissors. 
Then, using `random`, the computer chooses rock, paper, or scissors. 
Once both choices are in, the program compares the choices and prints the results.
